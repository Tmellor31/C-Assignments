I tested this assignment through a few methods: 
Small functions were tested via assert checks, and where appropriate through passing 
a string titled as 'test_input_string' - I have commented this out in test, but left in the code so 
an example of how I was testing can be seen. 

I also wrote ncl files to check the implementation of functions after writing them
in both my parser and interpreter - utilising the various exit messages to troubleshoot. 

I had notable issues with memory leaks, and found that if I utilised the free function I had made for interp,certain files such as fib.ncl would fail to work. I tested a few different methods, but have ultimately had to submit a version in which both the interpreter and parser work, but with notable memory leaks. Through using interp_s to troubleshoot I did manage to fix a buffer overflow error however.
