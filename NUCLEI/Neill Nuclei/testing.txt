I tested this assignment through a few methods: 
Small functions were tested via assert checks, and where appropriate through passing 
a string titled as 'test_input_string' - I have commented this out in test, but left in the code so 
an example of how I was testing can be seen. 
Some challenges arose as a result of avoiding spaces via the use of 'move_next_char'
to move to the next character rather than simply using brackets to seperate the words.


However, the advantage of this approach was that ncl files that span multiple lines
such as the attached 'multilinetest.ncl' still parse and interpret correctly. 


I also wrote ncl files to check the implementation of functions after writing them
in both my parser and interpreter - utilising the various exit messages to troubleshoot.
